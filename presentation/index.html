						<h1>Social Cause ?</h1>
						<h3 class="fragment">Good social habits in kids.</h3>
						<p class="fragment">We aim to cultivate good habits or impact the way people act to certain kind of situations. We feel that all people should have some basic habits which are expected by the society. These might be the kind of behaviour which are very fundamental to a society and lay the foundation of its stability.   
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>We believe that "character building" is very important. And this should start from childhood. Many of the problems of this world can be easily solved, if we have people willing to act for such bigger causes.
						</p>
						<p>And it may not require much effort, even small contributions in silly things can have a great impact.

						<h2>Gamifying the cause</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Changing one's morals and ethics is quite difficult to approach as it requires a concious effort from the other end.   
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>We rather decided to plan a game where we make the user "do" things and try to impact one's working memory.
						</p>
						<p>This would be like making habits where one would act to certain situations.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>And more importantly this should be natural impulsive response. Thoughtful persons make their own decisions and then habits are created out of them. But is that effective ? Definetly not in a country like India. So can these habits be created instead , if that is possible ?
						</p>
						<p>So we constraint this to short term actions about <span>silly things</span> which need immediate response.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section class="fragments">
						<p class = "fragment">For example let's propose the simple scenario of the garbage. We create a scenario where one has to act quickly (take quick decisions) about throwing trash in dustbin. 
						</p>
						<p class = "fragment">If one fails to do, we show him the scene where our cities are flooded by garbage. And on doing it right, we try to creat vibes of a positive city.

						<h2>GAME</h2>
						<p class="fragment">So we will have a 1st player game.   
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>There will be different scenes/situations which will be randomly given to the user.
						</p>
						<p>In each situation one has to take fast decisions to do the job. 
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>There will be three lives. If you fail a level you loose one life , and you move on.
						</p>
						<p>If you loose all lives , game is over and you get a score.</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section class="fragments"  data-transition="slide" data-background="#0F9D58">
					<section>
						<h2>Scenes</h2>
						<p class="fragment"> We will have following scenes/levels based on situations.    
						</p>
						<p class="fragment"> 1. Close the running tap as soon as possible.
						<p class="fragment"> 2. Turn off the lights in a room.
						<p class="fragment"> 3. Give way to an ambulance.
						<p class="fragment"> 4. Give seat to elderly in metro.  
						<p class="fragment"> <span>We don't explicitly say the aim/goal of the level, the user has to infer that.</span>
					</section>
					<section>
							<h2>Artifacts</h2>
							<p>These are a very important aspect of the game.</p> 
							<p>Since we are trying to include these habits into the player's reflexive memory , we need certain artifacts to activate their memory formation. For this we use <span>Easy Mental Calculation</span> in a gamy environment.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section  data-transition="slide" data-background="#DB4437">
					<h2>Score : contributions</h2>
					<p>The score after game over comes in terms of how many resources is saved during the play.</p>
					<p>We have option after every play to share one's contributions , where one can share his contributions on social media.</p>
					<p>Contibutions include number of humans saved , litres water saved.</p>
