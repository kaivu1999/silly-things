						<h1>Social Cause ?</h1>
						<h3 class="fragment">Good social habbits amongst kids.</h3>
						<p class="fragment">We aim to cultivate good habbits or impact the way people act to certain kind of situations. We feel that all people should have some basic habbits which are expected by the society. These might be the kind of behaviour which are very fundamental to a society and lay the foundation of its stability.   
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>For example let's propose the simple schenario of the garbage, if people have a "habbit" of putting trash they find near them in dustbin, it make a great impact. And more importantly this should be natural impulsive response. Thoughtful person's make their own decisions and then habbits are created out of them. But is that effective ? Definetly not in a country like India. So can these habbits be created instead , if that is possible :).

						<h1>Target Audience</h1>
						<h3 class="fragment">Kids ;) {age: 5+}</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Many a times the small and spontaneous acts that we do or the decisions that we make during certian situations have an impact on things.
						</p>
						<p class="fragment"> At a small age it is very difficult for children for conciously making such decisions. We try to improve this by targeting their working memory.
